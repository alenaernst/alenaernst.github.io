My research interests lie in **combinatorics**, particularly in **extremal combinatorics**, which includes the study of **Erdős-Ko-Rado theorems**, as well as **algebraic combinatorics**. I am especially interested in algebraic combinatorics because it involves the theory of **association schemes**, also providing a framework for addressing questions in extremal combinatorics. Additionally, I have a keen interest in the **representation theory** of finite groups, as it is essential for studying certain association schemes.

Furthermore the **representation theory** of finite groups is another of my research interests since it is necessary for the study of certain association schemes.  -->
